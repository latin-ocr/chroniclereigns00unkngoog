The feudal system was the exponent of the views of the
rulers, the allodial of those of the nation.

To William the Conqueror, as indeed probably to the &mamm tho
later Anglo- Saxon kings‚ the feudal system was doubt-less effi& nt or
1116 model system of government: to william it was the
only 0116 experimentally known. But it did not follow
that it was to be forced 111 all its details 011 an unwilling
people. He intended to be king of England, the king of
the nation as well as the conqueror of the crown3 and
whatever were the designs of william Rufus and Henry
1., Henry ΙΙ. followed in the steps of his greater ancestor.

Why could not a system be devised which should unite
the strength and unity of the higher institutione of
feudalism with the strength and unity of the lower insti· ·
tutions of 1116 ancient system? True the principle of
allodial tenure was to be extinguished, this had been done
in agreat measure before the conquest, but the institutione
of the system might be retained. The feuda] tenure was
to be universally enforced, but feudal jurisprudence was
not inseparable from it. In N ormandy itself the lower
organization of the feudal theory had never been carried
into details or actually displaced the original institutions
of the subject population.1

Was it possible 10 raise up a great seudal nobility that 333ss ml
would be all pow erful 111 dependence on and 111 defence of beron nm
the crown, but unwieldy and unmanageable if an attempt
should be made 10 1186 11 against the sovereign2 Would
it be possible 10 maintain the characteristic institutione
of the English nation in integrity for all purposes of peace,
justice, and security?

By the forfeitures of the great Saxon earldoms 111 1066 ἓξὲξ
and 1070, William was enabled at once to secure theu
former object. By the distribution of their estates ancln
dignities he cre· rted a new nobility on the ruins of the old,

which would be collectively strong, but would have as its
