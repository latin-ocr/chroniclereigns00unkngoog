It may be fairly a matter of conjecture whether this causo ottho
practical abrogation of 13116 tax was owing 136 a wish on 21ae ¹¹33ss οἵ
Henry’s part ’oo prove himself a worthy successor of 13116
Oonfessor, or ’oo a conviction that 113 was an unprofitable‚
unpopnlar, and impolitic impost‚ a small portion only of

which reached the exchequer 3 or whether the facts that

during the· years of Becket's chancellorship ’ohe Dane-

geld was not exacted, that in ’ohe year of his resignation

it reappears, and that in 13116 following year, after a sbout
resistance on his part, 113 was finally disused‚ point 130

13116 second martyr of Canterbury as the real deliverer

from the tart, which in its first. form the first martyr of
Canterbury, St. Elphege, had resisted to 13116 death.

The carucage which was levied by Richard Ι. 111 his

eighth year was, however, to all intents and purposes a

revival of this odious impost.

The next item of ancient revenue was the donum, or 111. 'rho
auxilium, names which bear evidence bo their original 2132&de
nature of contributions by 13116 vassals 130 assist the neces-
sities of their lords. The former term is applied to the
sums raised by the countieS, the latter to those by 13116 -f
towns. This impost· varied in amount. on occasion, and
there is no reason to suppose that, 11. was an annual tax,

It seems to have answered 136 what was known somewhat
later by the name of talliage‚ and in the thirty-first of
Henry Ι. appears only in 13116 form of auxilium burgorum,
being probably intended 136 be to the towns what, Dane-
geld was 130 ’ohe country.
The second year of Henry ΙΙ. was marked by some chmm

variatione from the older practice, which may be ascribed ¹¹⁵⁶·

with tolerable certainty ’oo the advice of Becket as chan-
cellor. ’ It was no doubt a year of extraordinary charge&
and one in which the more elastic methods of raising a
revenue by making up the arrears of legal proceedings
could not· be brought· into effective working. We
find in it accordingly the disappearance of Danegeld‚
coupled with the new arrangement of the donum,
