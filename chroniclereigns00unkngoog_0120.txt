we cannot find any basis for calculation. The immense

not of the numbers of the councillors. It is probable
that few of the inferior tenants attended, who neither

principles of delegation and election‚ already in use for
other purposeS, could not, so long as the councss con-

able for this. In this point the reign of Henry 11. does
