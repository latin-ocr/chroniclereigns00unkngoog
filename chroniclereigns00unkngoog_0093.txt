has pointed out the fact that the leading features of our tutinus.
parliamentary institu tions are traceable to the judicial
system of ancient times, The parliament is the highest
court of judicature3 the representative principle is iden·
tical with that of the jury: and it may be added that
the taxing power of parliament itself may be traced. in
the same way to the assessment by juries, of which
vestiges may be found from the era of Domesday Book

the reign of Hem-y ΙΙ., and was approved and recognized
by law under Richard Ι.

The revenue of the Anglo-Saxon kings arose princi· sou-reos or
pally from their demesneS, including both those which &¹3ssan
were kept in hand and those which were let at ferm at
rents payable for the most part in kind. Besides this
ordinary revenue‚ there were the Denegeld voted by the
Witan for tribute or for the defence against the Danes ;
and certain other payments known generally under the
name of geld or tax, which were probably derived from
commutatione of the trinoda necessitas, or special sums
levied for the support of the shipping.
