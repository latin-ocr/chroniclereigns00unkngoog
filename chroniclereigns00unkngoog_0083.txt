“ Curia Regis non recederent ; '’ and that this limitation orig-inor

has been very reasonably regarded as the· institution of gss‘ifflgfj

the Curia Regisin its third sense, in which it may be de· Bm'eh'
fined as a judieial committee 01 1116 king’s judicial council,
and which is probably the tribunal described by Glanvill
as “justiciarii sedentes in Ban00.’' 1
Previously to 1 178 all the members of the Curia Regis guteg‘ssssg

seem to have exercised the judicial 1611611011 111 1116 pomona

employed in

Curia and in the exchequer, as well as on the eyres, ge- &2⁰⁰⁸
nerally, as on the eyres, in committees of three 01 four.2
Now it would appear that the central jurisdiction was
entrusted to a single committee of five. As the six
who were appointed in nearly the same words, the fol-
lowing year, to be justices of the Curia Regis, were appa-
rently different persons from these five, with the excep-
tion of Glanvill, we may infer that the appointment 01
11116 committes was an annual or even a termina] one,
and that the judges 01 1116 Curia in this new form, 01,
66 we may 6611 them, 1116 36611666 01 1116 bench, were ‚a
temporary selection from 1116 whole body of judges, who
still discharged the offices of itinerant justices and
barons 01 1116 exchequer. That the itinerant justices
did not 1066 their places in the exchequer 16 61661, 110111
1116 1661 11161 111611 11611166 appear in the lists' of persons
before whom fines were levied in the Curia Regis at a
later period.⁸

We have unfortunately no account 01 further changes
in the constitution 01 1116 Curia Regis during this reign,
