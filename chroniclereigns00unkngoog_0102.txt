From this time the donum may be taken as the general

talum. name of the irregular impost. It was called also awi-

bbam, from the purpose which it was intended to serve,
and hidage, scutage, or talliage‚ from the mode of collec-
tion or special character of the impost. The ‘talliage or
auxilium burgorum was levied on the towns, the scutage

or donum simply on the tenants in socage. The peculial·
measure of the second year was the collection of scutage
from the knights’ fees holding of ecclesiastical superiore,
a measure which met with much opposition from arch-
bishop Theobald at the time} The amount actually
accounted for on the roll, as raised by this scutage, was
small, reaching altogether to not more that 5005. The ⁹‘
donum comitatus and auxilium burgorum raised the same
year about 2,¹7 ool. The whole sum accounted for on the
year, with the addition of the profits of law proceedings
and feudal incidente, is not much more than 220002.
The donum of the fourth year was collected in a diffe-
rent form and in different relative proportione. It is
possible that we should connect with the scutage on the
clergy in the second year the ordinance which, as we
learn from Robert de Monte,⁵³ was made in the third year
for the war in Wales, that every two knights or tenants
in chivalry should join to equip a third, by which means,
if we are to understand it literally‚ 90‚000 knights would
appear from 60,000 knights' fees. The scutage of 1156
