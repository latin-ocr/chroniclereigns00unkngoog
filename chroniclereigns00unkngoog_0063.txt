was that 116 was an elective one, and some form of accep· 3213&ss η
tance in the folkmote may have preserved the tradition ΜΝ officer-
of a time when it actually was so, But although the
name of vicecomes now becomes the equivalent of scyr-
gei-afa? it signifies no real dependence on or derivation
of authority from the earl. He was the king’s repre-
sentative, judicial, fiscal, and military, in the shire. The
earl has his third penny, but the authority rests with
the sheriff : the carl may be sheriff himself, but he ad- · ¹ ,
ministers the shire as sherifl', not as earl. So the megis- Changoor

hundred with its pless and profits is granted away to the

feudal castellan ;³ the view of frankpledge is severed from

the sheriff's tourn and leet and made one of the rights of

the feudal manor.

The retention of this lower machinery involved the Lowor
retention of the ancient process ofjurisdiction. In this, ffifflssffld
at least in its subordinate arrangements, the conquest 3355ss
produced little change except in the substitution of
Norman for English names and persons. But the position
of the N ormsn baron in the office of sheriff differed from
that of the Anglo-Saxon thane. Τ116 latter had his sak mmduc.

to these the N erman gladly put in the claim of succession z ”ww
but the N orman had besides, his barony in N ormandy
which he governed by strict N erman laW, to the process
of which, as giving more power to himself, 116 naturally
inclined to assimilate that of the English courts in which
he held either a personal 01· a ministeria] presidency.

The office of sheriff was in many cases hereditary and in
almost all was vested in some important feudal noble.

There were thus co-existing in the country three .
