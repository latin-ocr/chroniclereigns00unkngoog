tells that the ambition they served to restrain could not

have been of such a nature, if it existed at all ; but it is

needless to speculate upon them. Unscrupulous as men

were, the idea of unrighteous conquest from a Christian

prince did not enter into the ordinary morality of the

age, They fought for the settlement of quarrels‚ or for

the decision of doubtful claime, or for rivalry, or for the

love of war, but not for illegal conquest. In Henry's

*own wars this fact is clear, he never waged a war but on

feudal superstition, if it is not worthy of a higher name,

with regard to the person of Lewis, was so strong as to

exercise a visible restraint on his actual hatred. His

political common sense might well have told him that

the force which was enough to crush Lewis was not

strong enough to hold France. The difficulties he expe-

rienced in ruling the dominions which he already pos-

sessed, and the variety of nationalities already crowded

under one sceptro, were considerations that could not
