It is by no means easy to determine the exact force of¹¹
this measure It seems impossible to doubt that the0‘
eighteen were identical with the judges of the year 1176,
and that the intention was to prevent them from sitting
in the Curia Regis. lf the measure of 1176 really added
largely to the number of the judges, and was not merely
a rearrangemeut of their functione, there can be no doubt
that the increased number was burdensome, and that
the king intended to establish a new tribunal of five, to
the exclusion of the rest. Accordingly the measure has
been understood with great probability to imply the
erection of a. bank or bench in the Curia, to which the
title of Curia Regis subsequently became restricted, and

which is the original of the present Court of King's “

Bench.

But it seems probable that this act was attended by
the deposition of most of the eighteen from their judicial
functione altogether, or their relegation to subordinate
places in the Exchequer, for the iters were served in
1178 and 1179 ² by eight judges only, two of whom
were new appointments3 whilst on the redistribution of
circuite, which was made in 1179 and carried out in
1180, Ranulf Glanvill alone of the eighteen judges of
1176 was reappointed. Many, however, of the itinerante
of 1176 subsequently reappear in the transactione of the
Exchequer.
