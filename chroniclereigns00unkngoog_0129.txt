which were established under Henry ΙΙ. are distinctly ngrr 112³t
traceable under his grandfather, and although the legal {vsgffis ”⁰
reforms of Henry ΙΙ. run into details and have pecu-
liarities which distinguish them, and even give them a
‚true claim to the title of original conceptionS, they dc,

at least the most important of them, distinctly retain as

’ strong features of Anglo-Saxon as of N orman parentage.

And this Sir Francis Palgrave has himself shown even

whilst he ascribes to the heir of the Anglo-Saxon kings

the final abolition of the Anglo-Saxon legislation. There

cannot be in the mere application to novel disseisin and
mortdauncester, of the mode of procedure which had .
been long in use for other matters3 nor in Henry’s
extending to his English subjects forms of process which

had ipen the privilege of his N orman ones, grounds for

so sweeping a charge.

Henry’s genius as a. legislator is exemplified rather in character

the application and combination of principles, than in 1⁸12?ss 2⁰32*

the origination of them. That his reign witnessed the ⁰⁶⁸¹¹¹⁸m⁰⁶
amalgamation of the free of both nation‚ is an evident

fact. That ‚it was the period of the more complete de- Ἣιωωοῃ or
pression of the unfree is a theory that depends chiefly ienlfflss?

ceding, but in the following reigns.

A priori a period of despotic oppression, a reign of
terror, like that of Rufus, thirty years of rigorous sys-
tematic discipline like that of Henry I.‚ or twenty
years of anarchy such as had existed under Stephen‚
might seem a much more likely occasion for such a
revolution as that of which Sir Francis Palgrave writes.

But for the revolution itself proof is wanting, and
even if the phaenomena which are ascribed to its effects
are granted to have such an origin, it seems strange
justice to fix for the period of its occurrence a reign in
which every recorded measure tended to peace and
to the perfect equality of the 'two nationalities. As

for serfdom, far too little is known to enable us to say
