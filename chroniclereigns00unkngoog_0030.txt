toffiffisoe several mensures of Henry’s administrative reforms as

or Honry’· parts of a matured definite scheme, or as the expediente

{sssstfflggph and experiments of an adroit manager. The more care-

g÷¹g¹f÷ffi÷133fffully we study the remaining monuments of the earlier
reigns, or the character of Henry's ministare, the more we
may be convinced that his genius was rather adaptive
“ 'and digestiva than originative. When on the other
hand we examine the actual results of his reforms as
exemplified in the succeeding reigus‚ the more certainly
we see the differenoe between the earlier fragmentary
attempts at legislation and the definite system which
Hehry left behind him ς but on any view the industry,
energy, and readiness of his working were qualities of

the man himself.
Two It is obvious that Henry’s great design as well as the
ἳῖἒιῖἱῗίἓῗ his subordinate parts of it may, taken apart stom the general

character

drawn from tenour of his character, be read in two ways, or rather
{Jl‘issssfssifim that two opposing views of his character may be drawn
‘fii‘ti'vnaisss hoa from the bare consideration of his objeots and measures.
‘mm‘ It may seem that he wished to create a tyranny‚ to over-
throw every vestige of independence among the clergy
and nobles, and to provide himself from the proceeds of
taxation with means of carrying out personal selfish de-
signs. He might be a man who could endure no oppo-
sition‚ and to whom it was enough to make a thing
intolerable that it should be originated by any other than
⁸ himself. Such a reading would explain much of his
avertice, cruelty, and greediness in acquiring territory.

of his subjecte, as his judicial reforms were the basis

ons which the next generation was enabled to raise the
earlier stages of civil liberty; and as his ecclesiastical
measures have in nearly every particular been sanctioned

ruler‚ as well as to the credit of a far-sighted statesman.
