¹ There are four accounts of ᾖ John and Longchamp. This was
these transactions, stom the harmo- probably the result of the confer-mee

 

nizing of which the true chronology
of the year may be arrived at.
(1) The text, which is very short,
and contains no documents. (2)
Hoveden, who is equally brief in
narration, but gives a copy of a final
agreement between John and Long-
champ. (3) ‘Richard of Devizes,
who is more satisfactory, but whose
dates are inconsistent with one
another, and his final agreement
altogether different stom Hereden’s.
(4) William of Newburgh. From
the last it appears that Lougchamp’s
proceedings against Lincoln took
place early in the spring, before the
death of pope Clemeut 111. was
known, or the archbishop of Rouen
lauded ; aud that on the news of
the pope’s death, Longchamp made
a truce with John. Clement 111.
died about the end of March, and the
news of his death would reach Eng-
land about three weeks later. The
truce would then be made about the
end of April. Now the final agree-
ment given ΒΥ Richard of Devizes
bears date April 25, at winchester,
and is without doubt the document
drawn up on the occasion of the
truce mentioued ΒΥ William of
Newburgh ; but Richard gives it as
if it were concluded at a second
conserence at winchester on the
aeth of J uly. On the 27th of April
the archbishop of Bouen lauded ς
and both parties wenc againinarms
about midsummer. This campaign
was concluded, according to Νεν-
burgh, ΒΥ a second treaty between

dated ΒΥ Richard of Devizes J uly
28, and was embodied in the docu-
ment given ΒΥ Hoveden. We thus
get the dates, First siege of Lincoln,
and capture of Nottingham and
Tickhill, over before the middle of
April. First pesce of winchester,
in which arrangements were made
for an arbitratiom and John was
recognized as the heir of England‚
April 25. Arrival of the arch·
bishop of Rouen with stesh com-
mission and instructions, April 27.
Resumption of hostilities, second
siege of Lincoln, δια, after June 24.
Second peace of winchester, iu
which the arrangements about the
castles were completed‚ and in which
there is no recognition of John as
the heir, Jnly 28. Sir Francis
Palgravc (Introd. to Rau» qf Curia
Reqis, i. p. lv) supposes that both
acts were drawn up st the same
time. But this is disproved, (1) ΒΥ
the inconsistency of the dates of R.
of Devizes; (2) ΒΥ the fact that the
treaty of April 25 is provisionsl,
and that given ΒΥ Hoveden is finalz
(3) that the treaty ascribed ΒΥ R.
Devizes to April 25 contains no
mention of the archbishop of Rouen,
whilst in the one given ΒΥ novades
he occupies, as the representative of
the king, the most important pm
in the negotiations. This theory,
I think, obviates all difficulties, and
only requires that for the treaty of
July 28, Hoveden's copy should be
substituted in R. of Devizes for the
one he has given, which is really
