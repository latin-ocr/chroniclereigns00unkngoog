that this theory has ever been stated, but it would seem Questions
not improbable for several reasons. The great oppres· ”Saffssfa
siveness of the Danegeld of two shillings on the hide '
would render its collection a matter of difficulty, and it

would never be raised without considerable loss. A

fixed sum, on the other hand, must be paid into the
tressury. It is possible that this sum was fixed 011 0

low average, and that the sheriffs collected as well as

they could the old taz, keeping for their own pay the
difference between the sum collected and the sum paid

in. If this were sc, we can account for the fact that the
Danegeld was still reputed in 1178 to be a tax of two
shillings 011 1110 hide, whilst the actual reoeipt of the
exchequer was very small.

It may be questioned, however, further, whether the w„ it oom-
Danegeld itself was not compounded before it reached ffiffded
the hands of the sheriff, on the same principle on which
forfeitures and reliefs were fixed at an almost nominal
sum in the reign of Henry Ι. A man who owned
twenty hides might be allowed to pay Danegeld for five,
on the same principle that an abbot who owned twenty
knights sees was allowed to pay scutage for a fourth part.

Some countenance for the theory may be derived Proooofflngs
from the circumstances which 010 recorded by Becket’s 3513}ssss or

biographers as having taken place in the council at ἷξῖἳῗῗωκ

sum of “ two shillings 011 1110 hide, which were given to
