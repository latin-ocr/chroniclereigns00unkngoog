into the disposition of the goods of felons and fugitives
under the assize of Olarendon. This assize was then of
earlier date than 1170.

III. The assize itself contains in its last chapter a pro-
hibition against, the reception or protection os the heret-,ies
condemned in the Oouncil of Oxford. This council was
held in the king’s presence in the J anuary or February
of 1166.1

IV. But at the beginning of Lent, 1166 (March 3),2
Henry left England, and did not return until 1170, when
he immediately issued the eommission for the Inquesb os
Sheriffs.

The assembly at. which this assize was enacted must
be referred, therefore, to a date between N ew Year’s day
and the first day of Lent, 1166.

A Council of Olarendon 18 mentioned by Edward Grim

the euoo neu and by Roget· of Pontigny, in which an oath was exacted

from the bishops that they would not appeal to the pope.
This is very probably the identical council at which the
assize was passed, and may be fixed 'oo the year 1166 by
Grim’s statement, that “ per idem quoque tempus '² the
pope wrote to Roger of York a letter, dated at Anagm,
April 5‚1166.³
