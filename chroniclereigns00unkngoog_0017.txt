the judgment of contemporaries, and see whether such
111011 as they were would be likely to think as they have
done of such 0 111011 as we have described to ourselves

If we know enough of the facts of a man’s life we 0011
draw such a picture. character that is not shown in act
is not strong enough to be worthy of the name. The 111οι1 such
whose character is worth study must bc one whose acts Q? 1³..
bear the marks of character. In the view of 0 long life, diffisi&
some generalizations 0011 almost always be drawn, from
the repetition of acts, from the uniformity or uncertainty

vices of kingS, like those of other men, carry with them
their present punishment ; whilst with them, even more
signally than with other men, the accumulation of subse-
quent misery is distinctly conspicuous, and is seen to fall
with 0 weight more overwhelming the longer their
strength or their position has kept it poised.

It was not that their wickedness was of a monstrous munimn-
