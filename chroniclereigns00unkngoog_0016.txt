Orioni n· or N 6111161 can we accept the delineatione of contem-

ιΞιὲἓᾶι step. They are almost always superficial, but if that

as the verdict of ordinary judgeS, and it 16 always satis-
factory to know what a man's contemporaries thought
of him, even if they were neither close observers nor
judicious critics. But their descriptione are seldom to
be trusted even in this respect, for they betray almost
universally a bias for or against the 11610. The one in a

principles and motives, we can generalize somewhat as to

the inward life of a man if we know what 1116 outward
life was; and then we can compare our conclusion with
