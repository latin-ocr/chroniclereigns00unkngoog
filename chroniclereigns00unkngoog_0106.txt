Possibly in William’s estimation the consent of S. Thomas
took from the scutage on chureh fees its saerilegious

IV· Proflts The revenue raised from legal prooeedings, on which
θ’ ''¹⁸⁰¹“ Ralph Niger pours his especial vituperation, constitutes
from the time of the Assize of Clarendon a very im-
portant item in the national accounts. It does not seem,
however, in any year to have reached the amount raised
by the same means in the thirty-first of Henry Ι. The
placita of the itinerant justiees and justioes of the forest
begin to appear in the rolls of 1166, the levies on pur-
prestures emerging at tpe same time. Froin 1175 down-
wards we find entries of the placita Curiae* and of the
exehequer at uncertain intervals. Oblata Curiae appear
under distinct headings from the time of the establish-
ment of the bench in the king’s court, 11783 fines for
the transfer of property from the twenty-eighth year.

ssfflfflfffl course, so fluctuating that no calculation ean be made to
give even a fair idea of the average revenue derived from
them. In a general view of the receipts it would appear
that Henry II. never approaehed to the oppressive sums
raised by his grandfather stom this source. His reign
is marked by no great forfeitures except those of Wil-
liam Peverel and Henry of Essex,2 both of which were

strictly legal The escheats and seizures never remained
