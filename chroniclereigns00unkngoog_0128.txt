ngmrgvffsi. “ business that the money was counted on the exchequer
“ table on either side of the sea: the bailiffs in the

‘⁶ sheriffs to whom the bailiwicks of the shires were'
“ granted in England3 and the breves by which the
“ king administered the law, whether in the kingdom or

. This is not an isolated passage, but 6 specimen of 6
theory into which its illustrious author was drawn by
under-estimating the actual changes introduced at the
conquest, and the formal character of the portions of the
old system which were retained. It was necessary to
account for the phaenomena of the later age by supposin g
a period of rapid change, and for that later date, the
power and genius of Henry II. seemed to account. But
the arguments of the passage here quoted amount to
very little, and for the most part the indications apply
ssssssffigffly equally to the reign of Henry Ι. 111 1116 reign the laws

fleury ¹· that the clement could not be eliminated even in the

attempt to recall and codify the laws of the older 1666.
We cannot say that they had become Norman, because
there are so few vestiges of Norman customs with which
they can be compared, and because the probability is
great that the kings, having developed a system of law
or custom 111 their insular dominions, rather assimilated
the Norman practice to the English than the reverse.
The exchequer was governed on exactly the same prin-
ciples in Henry I.'s reign, as in Henry ΙΙ.’6; 61111 the
Norman exchequer and the English were under Henry Ῑ.
