lxviii PRErAcE.

{J} 2333?oe must be remembered that almost all the hereditary
’ sheriffdome had been aboliehed before this time3 pro-
bably before the :nst of Henry 1.‚ when we find the
administration of large clusters of counties in the hands
of a few great, officere of state. Under Henry IL, how-
ever, the several enunties or pairs of countieS, had
recovered their several eheriffS, and these officere were in
most cases local magnateS, and apparently held the
position for life. A very clean sweep was made of these

Ἰ in 1170, and if, is most important to observe that, in the
place of these unjust stewardS, Henry substituted mem-

bere of the Curia Regis and Exchequer‚ a measure which

 

-- Ι Went out. Stayed in. Ι Came in.
