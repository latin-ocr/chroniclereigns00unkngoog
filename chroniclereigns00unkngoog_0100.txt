tax can be no other than the Danegeld, and Henry’s
object may have been to collect the entire sum into the
treasury instead of the miserable fixed amounts which
were paid in by the sheriffs. Whether Thomas appeared
as the advocate of the sheriffs, who 'would be the first
losers by the change, or of the people, is not clear, but
the proposal to render ‘⁶ auxilium '' voluntarily to the
sheriffs instead of payment, does not favour‘ the former
supposition 3 such a proposal‚ on the ‚other hand, comes
with an ill grace from the statesman who had substi-
tuted fixed payments for persona] service in the case of
the scutage. The subject is one of the most obscure in
the whole of Becket's history. It is possible, however,
that Henry’s purpose was simply to revive the payment
of Danegeld3 and if this were so, it was defeated by the
primate's opposition‚ for no such tax was collected aster
the eighth year of Henry’s reign,1 the year preceding the ,
council of Woodstock.

N otwithstanding Ralph Niger’s assertion that Henry
renewed the ancient Danegeld (a statement which may
have been made in reference to the scene at Woodstock),
it is certain that the abolition or permanent disuse of
the tax is to be attributed to this king. It was collected
in the second year of his reign, in very nearly if not
exactly the same gross amount as in the 3lst Henry I.
From the third to the seventh years it was disused 3
in the, eighth it was collected in the same sums again,
and after that it disappears until the 20th year,2 when,
although summonses were issued for the collection of it,
there is no evidence to show that it was actually paid,
unless the word is used simply as a synonym for talliage.
