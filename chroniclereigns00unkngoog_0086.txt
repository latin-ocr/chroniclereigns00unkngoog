The theory that the importance of the chancellor owed
something to the 118180881 influence of Thomas Becket
with Henry ΙΙ. 1188, 81 different times, had able sup·
porters3 and a passage of John of Salisbury‚ in which
the chancellor 18 said to have cancelled unjust decisione, ¹ Α
1188 11888 adduced 111 proof of his exercising 8 rudimentary
equitable jurisdiction at this early time. The play on
the word 18 801, however, peculiar to this case, and, if it
11188118 anything, must refer to the official rather than to
1118 personal influence of 1118 chancellor, 1118 power of
wording and recording the decisions of the sovereign.

Another theory, 11118188 08 1118 same point, maintains
that 1118 chancellorship 18 Becket' 8 1181808 was advanced
from 1118 818111 10 1118 second rank of precedence after the
king3 but of 11118 Ι 888 find no definite proof. The
functione of the chancellor were more strictly connected
with the administration of justice than those of any other
officer of the Curia, except the justiciar. The constable
or the marshal or the chamberlain, merely as 811811, could
hardly have taken precedenoe of the keeper of the great
8881, and the chancellor was the second official in the
kingdom before 111088 offices had become attached -to
houses of first-rate baronial rank.

Whether, aster this was the case, the chancellor would
have maintained his precedence, unless he had been also

a bishop, may, I think, be doubted. From the very early ·

date at which the title of second ² from the king is given
to Beeket, it seems almost impossible to suppose that the
preoedence was given him for personal reasons ; and the
