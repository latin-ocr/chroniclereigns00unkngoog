11 mere capricious cruelty or wauton mischief. N either
were their missortunes of the appalling sort wrought out
by the Furies of Attio tragedy. Of such misery there
were not wanting instances, but not enough to give more
than an occasional luridness to 1110 picture. Nor was it

as in the case of the Stewarts‚ that the momentum of
inherited misfortune and misery had become a conscious
