xxiv PREFACE.

Un iro rm principle of the art of government. If there were any

ἕῗιῗῗῗιπῗῗι. sign of benevolence‚ any glimpse of the love of his people
apparent in his actions, he ought by 81] 11108118 to have
the credit of it 3 if there were any 811011 general tone in
his private life it might be allowed to give the key of
interpretation of his public life, and a harmony to his
whole character. But his life was violent and lawless ;
his personal design, wherever it clashed with his esta-
blished 11108811108, set them at 01100 aside.

afim& to enter into a question of the personal merit of S.
Thomas of Canterbury, or of the exact point for which hc
held out, and for which, in fact, 110 perished. We may
respect the stout-heartedness of the prelate without ap-

proving his cause, or we may approve his cause without

shutting our eyes to the violent and worldly spirit in ’

which he conducted it3 but when we find that in this
cause all the piety and wisdom of three centuries saw
the championship of Divine truth and justice against
sccular usurpation, we are not surely wrong in supposing
that the constitutions' of Clarendon were dated three
centuries too soon. Was Henry really three centuries
before his age2 If the answer is affirmative, we deny his
character as 8 statesman, and reduce him to a theorist.
In truth, it was as ancient customs that he wished to
restore them, not to force them as innovations. His 11118-
take was not that he anticipated the age of the reforma-
tion‚ but that he neglecte-d to consider that such was the
rapid progress of papal assumption, and its· acceptance‚
