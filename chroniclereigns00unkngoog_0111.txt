The new coinage was ready 1n 1158. It 18 referred by Nam
Hoveden to the year 1156, but it was probably a mea- i¹¹ ¹¹⁵⁸‘
sure which required some time for general acceptance,
and was accompanied by very severe measures against
the fraudulent moneyers. These are mentioned in the
rolls of the second year of the reign as punished by
mutilation. The first notice in the accounts, of Commu·
tatio Monetae, occurs in 1158: the former proceedings
were, therefore, in all probability preliminary to a
general enforcement of the act, which, however generally
welcome‚ would necessarily be attended with cases of
individual hardship.

The new coinage of 1180 was not favourably received, ¹ Newcoin ως
nor are we informed of the circumstances which ren· ¹¹¹ ¹¹⁸⁰
dered it necessary. It may, however, have been required
owing to the fraudulent management of the moneyers,2
who were very severely punished, being carted in setters
two and two to the king' 8 court, where they were com-
pelled to redeem themselves with a heavy fine. An
assiae was issued by which the payment of the old coin
was declared unlawful after Martinmas, and a new coin·
age was struck under the superintendence of Philip
Aymar, a native of Tonraine. Philip unfortunately Pumbmfflt
neglected to restrict himself to lawful transactione and ξ’,ξξξξεξω
was discovered to be conniving at the villanies of the
moneyers in the excheqner. The fact that he escaped
punishment on this occasion whilst minor offenders were
severely treated, is somewhat suspicions. He was par-

doned and escaped by the king's connivance to France.³
