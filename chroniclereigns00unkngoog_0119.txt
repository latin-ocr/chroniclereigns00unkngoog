We 6611 have no hesitation in identifying them with the
proper constituente of the feudal court of the king as
Lord Paramont of the land. But they are not the less
the national council, the direct successore of the Witena-
gemote; the sapientes and sapientiores of the nation.
The two characters were perfectly compatible, and the
limited number of persons qualified to take part in either
capadty, and the abolition of any tenure which would
allow of the existence of a class of influential men not
dependent directly on ’1116 king, necessitated such a union.

is to us, are matters on which, as there are few grounds
of argument, there will always be abundance of discus-
sion.¹ The position of the spiritual lords, who only
could trace their right to scats to 6 period earlier than
the institution of the baronial tenure, and whose liberties
only were provided for in the national charters, saves the

tenants in chief of the crown.

It is not clear what proportion of the classes sum-
