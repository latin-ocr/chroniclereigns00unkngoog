which had been won by their exertions the same position
that they saw the counts of Champagne and Vermandois

“ and the dukes of N ormandy and Burgundy bearing to

the crown of France, whose wearer was their near kins-
man‚ and far less indebted to them for his position ἲ Nor
were they unworthy to be the equals of kingS, much
less of French vassaIS‚ wHo counted among their inferior
members the house of Hauteville which was giving law
to Italy and threatening the Eastern empire.

There was much, moreover‚ in the condition of the

y conquered country which might seem to favour the claims
e of the nobles to feudal independence. England under

the Confessor had been broken up into great earldoms
or satrapieS‚ each containing many shires‚ and in fact
representing in some measure one of the ancient king-
doms of the Heptarchy. Each earl governed by autho-

preme in his earldom, both in war and in peace: but
the dignity was not necessarily hereditary, and although
probably given in theory for the life of the grantes, was
subject to the conditione of promotion and degradation.
The exact parallel for this state of things must be
sought in the contemporary condition of Germany and in
a much earlier condition of France. But the main
point of separate independent jurisdiction strongly re-
sembled the feudal division of the latter country. It
would have been the most natural thing in the world for

Hugh of AvrancheS, Roger Montgomery, or William Fitz ,

Osbern to have taken the place of Tostig, Swegen, and
Leofri'c. The urgency with which the local franchises of
the Anglo-Saxon lords were pressed by the N orman barons
to the exaltation of their own privileges may serve to
show that had the chance been given them they would
have gladly claimed the greater jurisdictions on a like
plea, As it was, they found themselves in relation to the
royal power, in a position actually less influential than
that which had been occupied by the Anglo-Saxon earls.
They had conquered England for William not for them-
