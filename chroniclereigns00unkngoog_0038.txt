reading of history, delighted in the conversation of acute
and learned men like his uncles,the kings of Jerusalem,
and his sons-in-law William of Sicily and Henry of
Saxony. He had a wonderful memory, ¹ well stored
with the Iessons of past times, and with the experiences
of constant journeys, on which he was careful to see
everything that was to be seen.

He had little regard for more than the merest forms
of religion ;2 like Napoleon Bonaparte, he heard mass
daily, but without paying decent attention to the cere-
mony. During the most solemn part of the service he
was whispering to his courtierS, or scribbling‚ or looking

violently blasphemous. See Gir.
Camb. de Inst. Pr. iii. 11. He neg-
lected confession, Ib. iii. 13.

Niger, but it is graphio enough to
be true3 ‘⁴ oratorium ingressuS,
“ picturae ant susurro vacabat,'’ p.
