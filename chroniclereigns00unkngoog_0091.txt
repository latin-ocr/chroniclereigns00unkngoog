is lost. It is called by Glanvill,
11. 7., “ Regale quoddam benefl-

And the provisions of it are quoted

² The text of this assize is lost3
it is referred to in Glanvill 33,
“ constitutio regni quae assisa no-
“ minatur.” Lib. xiii. l. Glanvill
mentions 311 “Α33133 Regni‚”
(lib. x. c. 12) forbidding suits
concerning the debts or tenements
of laymen to be decided in a court

“ sitoe.” This Assisa Regni 13 the
Constitutions of Clarendon, c. 15.

³ Lib. viii. 9., “per assisam de
“ consilio regni inde factam.'’
Compare, however, with that chap-
ter the assize of Northampton‚ 3. 3.,
and of clarendon, 3. 18, and the
laws of william the conqueror, i. 48.

Dialog. de Scacc. p. 47.

⁸ Frequent traces of this may be
found in the present work. Ralph
de Diceto seems to say that forest
charges vere trumped up against
offenders against whom nothing
could have been proved at law.
Ralph Niger says, ‘⁶ Avibus omli,

168, and “ legem quoque de fores-
