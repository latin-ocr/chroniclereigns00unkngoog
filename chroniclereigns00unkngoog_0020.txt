„mut It would be a great mistake to view the personal and
ffigssffl‘ffoin political character of Henry as one of unmingled viee.
t1⁸1¹: ⁰¹ *¹⁰¹¹* It was a strange compound of inconsistent qualities
rather than a balance of opposing oneS, yet the incon--
sistencies were so compounded as to make him restless
rather than purposeleSS, and the opposing qualities were
balanced sufficiently to suffer him to carry out a consis-
tent policy. His fortunas, therefore, bear the impress of
the man. He was a bravo and consummate warrior, yet
he never carried on war on a large scale, or hesitated to
accept the first overtures of peace.l He was impetuous
and unscrupulous, yet he never tempted fortune. He
was violent in hatred, yet moderate in revenge 3² a lover
of good men, a corrupter of innocent women3 at once re-
ligious and profane, lawless and scrupulous of right3 a
maker of good lawe, and a. seller of justice 3³ the most
patient and provoking of husbands 3 the most indulgent
and exacting of fathers ; playing with the children, whose
ingratitude was breaking his heart, the great game of
statecrast as if they had been pawns. He was tyran-
nical in mood without being a tyrant either in principle
or in the exigencies of policy. In power and character,
by position and alliances‚ the arbiter of Western Europe
in both war and peace,4 he never waged a great war or
enjoyed a sound peace ; he never until his last year made
an unsatisfactory peace or fought an unsuccessful battle.
The most able and successful politician of his time, and

· thoroughly unscrupulous about using his power for his
own ends, he yet died in a position less personally im-
portant than any that he had occupied during the thirty-
five years of his reign, and, on the whole, less powerful
