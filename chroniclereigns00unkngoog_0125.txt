of J ohanna, and the reconciliation of the archbishops of Privato
Canterbury and York‚ were referred by Henry to the fflffiffiff
Great Council‚ and deeided by him 011 111011 recommen-
dation. In one particular we gain a glimpse of an im-
portant constitutional point, when we find the king
asking of his Council leave to quit the kingdom3 the

cases in which it is recorded may be merely complimen-

tary, but the form itself has considerable significance.

These details are in themselves quite insufficient to ffilnen?

presumption as to the real relations between Henry and
his council, the king and the parliament. If he could have
dispensed with it, his calling it together on 00 many oc-
casions shows that he wished to maintain constitutional
forms: if he could not, the fact that. these assemblies
were held so regularly proves that 110 was able to carry
011 1110 government either through them or in the most
friendly relations with them. It 10· probable that he
could have acted without them, for the baronage was
thoroughly humbled‚ and the adherence of the people
was secured. We may infer from this that when hc
asked advice 110 wanted it, and gladly availed himself
of constitutional forms for eliciting it. On the business acigni'ffirffi-
of the kingdom it may be fairly said that a strong outjealouss·
government such 00 Henry’s was 10 always amenable to
advice. Where there was no room for jealousy, good
oounsel was much more likely to be taken than under a
balanced constitution, where each constituent is afraid
to accept advice 1001 11 should grant too much authority
to the giver. The difficulties of limited monarchy arise
from the indefinable limits of regal and parliamentary
power. Henry was wise enough 10 know his own ο
strength, and strong enough to take good advice from
whatever quarter it came.

Matters did not however always work smoothly. The opcasiotpal
