nestoratgon We are to understand by this the restoration cf the

Μ’ · been one of the charges laid by public opinion against
Stephen; ¹ and the abolition of the coinage of these
usurping nobles wh0, amongst the other royal rights
which they had arrogated‚ had each for himself coined
money with his own mark. But Henry’s measures went
further still He abolished the local differenees of the
coinage which had subsisted from the days of the Hept—
archy, and instituted a uniform currency for the whole
kingdom. Fui-ther, by insisting on the payment at the
exchequer of the lawful coin of the realm only? he
threw out of circulation the debased money which was
still current in his foreign territorieS. His proceedings
were not, indeed, altogether successful: the next reign
witnessed another attempt to enforce a uniform system
of weights and measurae: even to the praee'nt day we are
experiencing how powerful local customs in this respect
are against law and common sense, as well as against
the empirical innovatione of financial theorists. But
the reformation of the coinage was probably in a great
measure completed‚ and it must have been in the first in-
stance, at least, a welcome change to a nation weary of the
debased‚ mutilated, and mongrel coin which had afforded

so much room for exaction‚ cheatery, and litigation.
