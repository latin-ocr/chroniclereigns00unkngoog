raasson. xxiii

Both of these views have been advocated, the first by nono or
some of his contemporaries, and those who in later times affixi„
have approached the history from their point of preju-
dice ; the latter by those wh0, both anciently and
recently, have been inclined to look with too professional
an eye on the character of his reforms. I have stated
already that I think neither of them tenable; and as it
is at present Henry’s personal character that is before
me, I will give the reasons.

As to the first theory, which, in the mouths of his (ι) Noither

contemporaries, seems so condemnatory, it must be said {1¹} ἕιῗιὲῗὲοῧῖ

that gratuitous baseness was no part of Henry's cha- fflpffi⁸
racter, if we may judge by his actions. ⁸He was
thoroughly unscrupulous and unprin cipled, but he was
not a tyrant3 he was not wantonly cruel or oppressive.
His crimes against public law and order, such as they
were, were not purposeless, nor is it in any way neces-
sary to suppose that he had that intolerance of all
opposition which pursues tyranny for its own sake. He
had definite aims, and followed them unrelentingly3
whatever could be made to minister to their furtherance
was forced to its use. As his passions gave way to his
policy, so the minor measures of his policy were some-
times compelled to give way to the occasional exigencies

’ of his great design. But where there was no definite

object, he was not a tyrant.

The theory that he was a benevolent governor or a g), aaz

far-sighted statesman is not supported, either by the seman to bo
apparent purpose of his reforms, or by their actual result. ffldssdrssm.
It requires no particular benevolence to teach a king
that his subjects are more contented when justice is fairly
administered than when violence reigns unrepressed;
and that where they are contented‚ they are more
likely to be industrious‚ and more able to pay taxes3
that where they have more at stake, they are more ready
to make sacrifices to purchase security; but this is no

lesson of far-sighted statesmanship‚ for it is the simplest
