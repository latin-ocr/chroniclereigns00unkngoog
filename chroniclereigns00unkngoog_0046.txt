¹¹⁰ ‘'lem'’ system which it was the Conqueror’s object to retain and
administer by his own vassals, sar the most important
place was given to the clergy, the prelates being by
virtue of their spiritual character the chief members of

occupying a position co-ordinate with royalty itself.
The king was not a king until he was crowned, and
