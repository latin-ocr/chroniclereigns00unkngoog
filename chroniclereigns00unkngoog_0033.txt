both in England and on the continent, since the age of 'rho ‘¹¹1³ssss
Hildebrand, that his “ ancestral rights ” were really left ἷιῗοοξεῖε
high and <hy behind the advancing flood which he vainly ἲέἓωζζιὲἓ
thought to stem. The policy to which feudal antiquity ῗῗέἰωέῗιῑ
had been forced to yield was really powerless against wiffr-
the increasing tide of ecclesiastical authority. The point

which eluded the sagacity of Henry was identical with

that which the conqueror himself had overlooked when

he established ecclesiastical courts to take cognizance of

the secular offences of the clergy. Both saw ‘the im-
possibility of reconciling royal supremacy with the

claims of feudal antiquity; but in ecclesiastica] matters
william yielded to, or perhaps helped on, the first
trickling of the stream which Henry had to withstand

in its full force. It was as necessary to william to
strengthen as it was to Henry to weaken the power of

the clergy. Henry should not have expected to find

in Becket one who would at once fill the seat and
reverse the mensures of Lanfranc.

and he, without scruple end without remorse‚ tried to ii‘iffflszeh‘
enforce them by all meane, fair and foul. If he was not ”ffl‘

by any consideratione but those of expediency from
trying to win his geme.

It seemS, then, that there is a third and a truer {hgffiffl‘ss

reading of this eventful life, one which makes no demand {wgffimmt

on our credulity like the second, and which requires no no proor or
harsh construction of simple actions like the first. Hem-y 3³53&OE
wished to create, at home and abroad, a strong govern- ἓῖεῗροῗιο
ment. In this itself there was nothing deserving the mm
name of tyrannica13 at the worst it was less of a tyranny
than that which had been in use in the three Norman
reigns, and had been exercised on both sides in the con-
tests of that of Stephen. As governments were in those

dayS, any might be accounted good which was conducted
