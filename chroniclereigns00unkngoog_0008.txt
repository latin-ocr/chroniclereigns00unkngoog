Τ116 works to be published in octav0, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibih‘ty of the task
resting upon the editorS, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a careful
consideration of the subject, expresscd their opinion in a

· ’1116631115Γ Μ1111116, dated February 9, 1857 , that the plan

recommended by the Master of 1116 Rolls “ was well
calculated for 1116 accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to economy, 111 making the detailed. arrange·
11161113, without unnecessary expense.”

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible cor-
rectness the text of each writer, derived from 6 0011611011
of the best MSS„ and that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative of the various readings,
They suggested, however, that the preface to each work
should contain, in addition to the particulare proposed
by the Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of
the author, so far as authentic materials existed for that
purpose, and an estimate of his historical credibility and
value.
