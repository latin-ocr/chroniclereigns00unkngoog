at the conquest has been generally as much everstated
on the one side as underrated on the other. One school
of historica] writers sees in the. Norman policy very little
more than a crystallization of a process which was going
on rapidly in the same direction during the last century
of Anglo-Saxon rule3 the other regards it as a complete
sub version of both persons and institutione. I believe
the truth to be that the plan of the Conqueror was simply

ι to dovetail a feudal superstructure into the fundamental

framework of the Anglo-Saxon polity.

That there was nothing radically inconsistent. in the
two systems is historically clear3 both sprang from the
same home in the Teutonic foreste. The allodial or
Saxon system was that of the Germans at home, the
feudal or Frank system was their policy as settlers
and conquerere.¹ william came with a band of feudal

organism. The cohesion was weakest as the pyramid
should have risen to an apeX. In the feudal system the
cohesion was the strongest above3 the principle of unity ’
was fidelity to the superior, not the maintenance of the
distinct freedom of the individual by voluntary associa-
tion. At the foundation of the former was liberty, at
that of the latter serfdom. The common medium was
land, the possession of which was in the allodial system
the proof of freedom, in the feuda] the occasion of service.

even further in ascribing it to the
Roman law.
