The bishop of nereford, who died
Feb. 27, 1167, is spoken of as living.
The news of the death of the bishop
of Lineoln (Jan. 27, 1167), and of
the earl of Esscx (Oet. 21, 1167),
mentioned in Ep. 344, must have
been unauthenticated, unlees those
events are wrongly dated by the his-
·torians, or the letter itself has been
interpolated. The dates are very
important in reference to transue-
116116 with Flanders and Boulogne.
