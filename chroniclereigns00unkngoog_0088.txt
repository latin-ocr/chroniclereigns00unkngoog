lxxx PREFACE.

ggffjggfosshe arose, it seems certain that his actual judicature sprang
⁶ ont of his office as president of the king's council.¹ It
belongs to the investigator of our later legal history to
examine how this took place, as well as to decide the

steps by which, from the union of the council with the

chronological arrangement of them as I have attempted
