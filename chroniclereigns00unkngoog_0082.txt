itinerant justices were restored by the same act, but
within a few years their visitations became septennial,
and they were gradually and finally superseded by the
devolution of their function on justices of assize.

Effi-{ffi The appointment of Ranulf Glanvill to the office of
justiciar’· justiciar in 1180 probably relieved the king from the
necessity of that constant legislation on judicial matters
which marks the previous ten years. It ie another im-
portant coincidence that this appointment synchronizes
so nearly with our first clear indication of the existence
of a limited tribunal erected in the Curia RegiS, to which
very shortly the name of Curia Regis became appro-
priated, and with which the famous book of Glanvill has
so important a connexion.
gig-ff& The Curia Regis in its earlier and wider sense was

the functione of the Witenagemote, and which was held
three times a year by the Conqueror. But although this
council acted on occasion as a court of justice, its judicial
functione and name were soon shared with that small
portion of it which remained continuously about the
king’s person. In this restricted sense it consisted of
the great officers of the household‚ the justicium chan-
cellor, treasurer‚ and barons of the Exchequer‚ with such
of his clerks as the king might summon, and it probably
included the stewards of the honours and constables
of the caetles which were in the king’s hands, br in
demesne. It was on the justiciar and the officere of the
Exchequer under him who bear the title of both justices
and barons that the principal burden of judicial pro·
ceedings fell, and to them, as we have just seen, the
commissions of provincial jurisdiction were entrusted.
Hffimoe We have seen that in 1 178 Henry substituted a tri-

⁸ Curia, with the direction, “ Quod illi quinque audirent
