The nobles who accompanied william were not likely {RQ-‚g

to fall in with such a plan. For feudal reciprocity in its πωπω ottho
proper sense they might have had little or no favour, but Ξῗιῗξῖοπ·

of nobles who were becoming fiercer and prouder as they
became fewer.

These men were ready enough to take advantage of
such points of feudalism as favoured their own inde-
