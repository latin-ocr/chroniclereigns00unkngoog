ffhrtge f distinct systems of lower jurisdiction‚ exclusive of the

fflte ecclesiastical courts, I. The ancient· courts of the hun-

tionss· dred and the shire, popular in origin and process and
coeval probably with Anglo-Saxon civilization ; presided
over by magistrates whose election was claimed by the
