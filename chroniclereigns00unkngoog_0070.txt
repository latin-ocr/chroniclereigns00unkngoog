ΨΜ· ωξιθ portant judicial epoch‚ and is not merely a unique relic ,
ffiffim of a system which had 11668 18 silent operation ‚for some
history. time, may appear from the following considerationis In
the first place the instructions have a retrospective vieW,
and the point to which they look back is 1116 commence-
ment of the king's reign. They are not, as the famous
Constitutions of Clarendon were, an enunciation of con-
suetudines, 11111. both in form and substance a new legis-
lative acia, and 11116 first chapter contains directions for ,
68 inquest into all cases of murder and robbery that had
occurred, not since the last iter, but “ postquam dominus
“ rex fuit re1.” The inquest of sheriffs in 1170,1 08 the
other hand, directs the barons errant to inquire into the
reoeipts of those offic-ers since the king went abroad, a
point of time coinciding with our supposed date of the
Assize of Olarendon‚² and 11116 reference of the same in-
quesb, and of 11116 Assize of N orthampton in 1176 to this
assize, points to 1116 inference that it, was a distinctly
recognized measure of reform. The oblivion into which
the assize has fallen among the early historians may
easily be 6660118166 for by the superior importance which
the Council of Clarendon of 1164 held in common asti-

mation. We have no real contemporary historian of the

to the king. See choand 18 of
the Assize, and the Assize of She·
riffs, 6. 6. It is called “Regia
“ constitutio qnae ,est pro bono
‘⁶ pacis.'’ Dial. p. 48. It is well to
observe that the chattels of fugitives
are accounted for earlier than 1166
in some instanoes, as in Nol-thum·
bei-land, Rot. Pip. lo ἃ, 11 Hen. 1L;
(and cf. Const. Clarendon, xiv„
which shows that the confiscation
os the goods of felons was already
in use), but that the chattels of
those ‘⁶ qui perierunt in judicio
“ aquae,” ‘⁴ fugitivorum et 6011118

to be accounted for 18 the rolls of
the 12111 of Hem-y Π. Τ116 roll of
the 15th mentions the Assize of
clm-endon by name, ‘⁴ Idem vice·
“ comes reddit compotum de catal-
“ 118 fugitivorum et suspensorum
“ per assisam de clarendon.” Ma-
dox, Hist. Exch. p. 236. And the
Assize of Northampton is named in
exactly the same terma 111 the rolls
of the 22nd.
